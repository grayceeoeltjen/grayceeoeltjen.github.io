    "text": "Nebraska basketball fans have known for a long time that Pinnacle Bank Arena is more than just a venue- it’s an experience. The energetic atmosphere and the famous loyalty of Nebraska fans creates one of the most electrifying arenas in college basketball. This can feel like an intimidating environment for the visiting teams, making it tough to play in. PBA is often said to be one of the best home-court advantages in the country, but does the data actually back this up?\nSurprisingly, the answer might not be as clear as we think. Do the Huskers perform better at home? Do the visiting teams struggle more? Especially after this past season, losing more home games than they have in the past couple of years, it raises the question: how much of an advantage is PBA really providing?\nIt turns out, the numbers may suggest a different narrative than the one we might expect. At least for the men’s team.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(hoopR)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nteam_box &lt;- load_mbb_team_box(2025)\n\nhuskers &lt;- team_box |&gt;\n  filter(team_name == \"Cornhuskers\")\n\nhuskershome &lt;- huskers |&gt;\n  filter(team_home_away==\"home\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=huskers, aes(x=reorder(game_date, team_score ), weight=team_score)) +\n  geom_bar(data=huskershome, aes(x=reorder(game_date, team_score), weight=team_score), fill=\"red\") +\n  coord_flip()+\n  labs(title=\"Does Nebraska Score More at Home?\",\n       subtitle = \"Playing at PBA doesn't always mean more points for the Huskers.\",\n       caption=\"Source: Sports Dataverse (hoopR) | By Graycee Oeltjen\",\n       y= \"Nebraska Points Scored\", x = \"Game Date\") +\n theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 18),\n    panel.background = element_rect(fill = \"white\", color = NA),\n    plot.background = element_rect(fill = \"white\", color = NA),\n    panel.grid.major = element_line(color = \"lightgrey\"),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis bar chart shows home games in red, and away games in a dark grey. Interestingly, the highest-scoring game of the season wasn’t played at Pinnacle Bank Arena- it was on the road. On March 4, 2025 Nebraska scored 114 points in an overtime loss at Ohio State. In addition to this, the Huskers’ lowest-scoring game happened at home.\nWhile the Huskers did have home games in the top half of this chart, showing higher scores at home, there are also a lot of home games in the bottom half of the chart. Not exactly enough of a difference to call this as extreme of a home-court advantage as it is made out to be as far as scoring goes for Nebraska.\nBut what about their defense?\n\n\nCode\nhuskers2 &lt;- huskers |&gt;\n  filter (opponent_team_short_display_name %in% c(\"Ohio State\",\"Iowa\",\"Maryland\"))\n\nia &lt;- huskers2 |&gt; filter(opponent_team_short_display_name == \"Iowa\")\nmd &lt;- huskers2 |&gt; filter(opponent_team_short_display_name == \"Maryland\")\nohs &lt;- huskers2 |&gt; filter(opponent_team_short_display_name == \"Ohio State\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_line(data=ia, aes(x=team_home_away, y=opponent_team_score, group=opponent_team_short_display_name), color=\"yellow\") +\n  geom_point(data=ia, aes(x=team_home_away, y=opponent_team_score, group=opponent_team_short_display_name), color=\"yellow\") +\n  geom_line(data=md, aes(x=team_home_away, y=opponent_team_score, group=opponent_team_short_display_name), color=\"black\") +\n  geom_point(data=md, aes(x=team_home_away, y=opponent_team_score, group=opponent_team_short_display_name), color=\"black\") +\n  geom_line(data=ohs, aes(x=team_home_away, y=opponent_team_score, group=opponent_team_short_display_name), color=\"red\") +\n  geom_point(data=ohs, aes(x=team_home_away, y=opponent_team_score, group=opponent_team_short_display_name), color=\"red\") +\n  \n  geom_text(data=ia |&gt; filter(team_home_away == max(team_home_away)), aes(x=team_home_away, y=opponent_team_score, group=opponent_team_short_display_name, label = \"Iowa\"), \n          nudge_x = .1, color = \"#D4AF37\", nudge_y = 1.3, fontface = \"bold\") + \n  geom_text(data=ia |&gt; filter(team_home_away == min(team_home_away)), aes(x=team_home_away, y=opponent_team_score, group=opponent_team_short_display_name, label = \"Iowa\"), \n          nudge_x = -.1, color = \"#D4AF37\", fontface = \"bold\") + \n  \n  geom_text(data=md |&gt; filter(team_home_away == max(team_home_away)), aes(x=team_home_away, y=opponent_team_score, group=opponent_team_short_display_name, label = \"Maryland\"),\n          nudge_x = .15, nudge_y = -.7, fontface = \"bold\") + \n  geom_text(data=md |&gt; filter(team_home_away == min(team_home_away)), aes(x=team_home_away, y=opponent_team_score, group=opponent_team_short_display_name, label = \"Maryland\"),\n          nudge_x = -.15, fontface = \"bold\") + \n  \n  geom_text(data=ohs |&gt; filter(team_home_away == max(team_home_away)), aes(x=team_home_away, y=opponent_team_score, group=opponent_team_short_display_name, label = \"Ohio State\"), nudge_x = .17, color = \"red\", fontface = \"bold\") + \n  geom_text(data=ohs |&gt; filter(team_home_away == min(team_home_away)), aes(x=team_home_away, y=opponent_team_score, group=opponent_team_short_display_name, label = \"Ohio State\"), nudge_x = -.17, color = \"red\", fontface = \"bold\") + \n\n  labs(title=\"How Does Nebraska's Defense Look at Home?\",\n       subtitle = \"This seasons, the Huskers defense looks to work better at PBA\",\n       caption=\"Source: Sports Dataverse (hoopR) | By Graycee Oeltjen\",\n       y= \"Opponent Points Scored\", x = \"Home or Away (For Nebraska)\")+\n theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 18),\n    panel.background = element_rect(fill = \"white\", color = NA),\n    plot.background = element_rect(fill = \"white\", color = NA),\n    panel.grid.major = element_line(color = \"lightgrey\"),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the 2024-2025 season, there were three teams Nebraska played both at home and away: Iowa, Maryland, and Ohio State. On the left side of the slope chart, it shows the opponents’ points scored when the Huskers were the visiting team, while on the right side, it shows the points scored when the opposing team came to play at PBA.\nIowa and Ohio State struggled more offensively when they came to play at Nebraska, while Maryland actually scored more points as the visiting team. Lower points for the opposing teams typically point to stronger defensive efforts, which could suggest some home-court advantage on the defensive end.\nStill, the results aren’t overwhelming. While the Iowa and Ohio State games make a case for some impact, it’s not enough to fully support the narrative of the high advantage PBA is believed to provide.\nAnother note- of the six games plotted above, Nebraska won one of those. So the next question is, do the Huskers actually win more games at home?\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(waffle)\nlibrary(patchwork)\nlibrary(grid)\nlibrary(gridExtra)\n\nhuskerswin &lt;- c(\"Home Wins\" = 10, \"Away Wins\" = 6)\nhuskerslose &lt;- c(\"Home Losses\" = 6, \"Away Losses\" = 8, 2)\n\nwaffle_grob &lt;- grid.grabExpr({\n  iron(\n    waffle(huskerswin, \n           rows = 3, \n           title = \"Nebraska's Wins\", \n           xlab = \"1 square = 1 win\", \n           colors = c(\"red\", \"black\")),\n    \n    waffle(huskerslose, \n           rows = 3, \n           title = \"Nebraska's Losses\", \n           xlab = \"1 square = 1 loss\", \n           colors = c(\"red\", \"black\", \"white\"))\n  )\n})\n\nmain_title &lt;- textGrob(\"Are the Huskers More Likely to Win at Home?\",\n                       gp = gpar(fontsize = 14, fontface = \"bold\"),\n                       just = \"center\")\nsub_title &lt;- textGrob(\"Out of all of Nebraska's wins and losses, there seemed to be more wins at home and more losses on the raod.\",\n                      gp = gpar(fontsize = 10),\n                      just = \"center\")\ncaption &lt;- textGrob(\"Source: Sports Dataverse (hoopR) | By Graycee Oeltjen\",\n                    gp = gpar(fontsize = 8, fontface = \"italic\"),\n                    just = \"center\")\n\ngrid.newpage()\ngrid.draw(arrangeGrob(\n  main_title,\n  sub_title,\n  waffle_grob,\n  caption,\n  ncol = 1,\n  heights = c(0.1, 0.07, 1, 0.05)\n))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn these waffle charts it is pretty simple- red is home games and black is away. The top chart shows Nebraska’s wins in the 2024-2025 season while the chart on the bottom shows the losses.\nNebraska finsihed the season with a 10-5 record at home and a 6-8 record on the road. So yes- the Huskers did win more at home, but not by a wide margin. Considering the reputation of PBA, you might expect a more dominant home record.\nWhile there are multiple other seasons worth looking at for Nebraska men’s basketball, it is pretty clear that the believed home-court advantage wasn’t a major factor for the Huskers this season.\nPinnacle Bank Arena continues to be a beloved home for Nebraska basketball and its loyal fans, but the 2024-2025 season shows us that the atmosphere alone isn’t what wins games.\nMaybe the real question isn’t if Pinnacle Bank Arena gives Nebraska an advantage, but rather how the team uses it. I believe if the Huskers use the energetic environment of PBA more efficiently, that will be what turns close games into wins."
