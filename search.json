    "text": "Nebraska basketball fans have known for a long time that Pinnacle Bank Arena is more than just a venue- it’s an experience. The energetic atmosphere and the famous loyalty of Nebraska fans creates one of the most electrifying arenas in college basketball. This can feel like an intimidating environment for the visiting teams, making it tough to play in. PBA is often said to be one of the best home-court advantages in the country, but does the data actually back this up?\nSurprisingly, the answer might not be as clear as we think. Do the Huskers perform better at home? Do the visiting teams struggle more? Especially after this past season, losing more home games than they have in the past couple of years, it raises the question: how much of an advantage is PBA really providing?\nIt turns out, the numbers may suggest a different narrative than the one we might expect. At least for the men’s team.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(hoopR)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nteam_box &lt;- load_mbb_team_box(2025)\n\nhuskers &lt;- team_box |&gt;\n  filter(team_name == \"Cornhuskers\")\n\nhuskershome &lt;- huskers |&gt;\n  filter(team_home_away==\"home\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=huskers, aes(x=reorder(game_date, team_score ), weight=team_score)) +\n  geom_bar(data=huskershome, aes(x=reorder(game_date, team_score), weight=team_score), fill=\"red\") +\n  coord_flip()+\n  labs(title=\"Does Nebraska Score More at Home?\",\n       subtitle = \"Playing at PBA doesn't always mean more points for the Huskers.\",\n       caption=\"Source: Sports Dataverse (hoopR) | By Graycee Oeltjen\",\n       y= \"Nebraska Points Scored\", x = \"Game Date\") +\n theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 18),\n    panel.background = element_rect(fill = \"white\", color = NA),\n    plot.background = element_rect(fill = \"white\", color = NA),\n    panel.grid.major = element_line(color = \"lightgrey\"),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis bar chart shows home games in red, and away games in a dark grey. Interestingly, the highest-scoring game of the season wasn’t played at Pinnacle Bank Arena- it was on the road. On March 4, 2025 Nebraska scored 114 points in an overtime loss at Ohio State. In addition to this, the Huskers’ lowest-scoring game happened at home.\nWhile the Huskers did have home games in the top half of this chart, showing higher scores at home, there are also a lot of home games in the bottom half of the chart. Not exactly enough of a difference to call this as extreme of a home-court advantage as it is made out to be as far as scoring goes for Nebraska.\nBut what about their defense?\n\n\nCode\nhuskers2 &lt;- huskers |&gt;\n  filter (opponent_team_short_display_name %in% c(\"Ohio State\",\"Iowa\",\"Maryland\"))\n\nia &lt;- huskers2 |&gt; filter(opponent_team_short_display_name == \"Iowa\")\nmd &lt;- huskers2 |&gt; filter(opponent_team_short_display_name == \"Maryland\")\nohs &lt;- huskers2 |&gt; filter(opponent_team_short_display_name == \"Ohio State\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_line(data=ia, aes(x=team_home_away, y=opponent_team_score, group=opponent_team_short_display_name), color=\"yellow\") +\n  geom_point(data=ia, aes(x=team_home_away, y=opponent_team_score, group=opponent_team_short_display_name), color=\"yellow\") +\n  geom_line(data=md, aes(x=team_home_away, y=opponent_team_score, group=opponent_team_short_display_name), color=\"black\") +\n  geom_point(data=md, aes(x=team_home_away, y=opponent_team_score, group=opponent_team_short_display_name), color=\"black\") +\n  geom_line(data=ohs, aes(x=team_home_away, y=opponent_team_score, group=opponent_team_short_display_name), color=\"red\") +\n  geom_point(data=ohs, aes(x=team_home_away, y=opponent_team_score, group=opponent_team_short_display_name), color=\"red\") +\n  \n  geom_text(data=ia |&gt; filter(team_home_away == max(team_home_away)), aes(x=team_home_away, y=opponent_team_score, group=opponent_team_short_display_name, label = \"Iowa\"), \n          nudge_x = .1, color = \"#D4AF37\", nudge_y = 1.3, fontface = \"bold\") + \n  geom_text(data=ia |&gt; filter(team_home_away == min(team_home_away)), aes(x=team_home_away, y=opponent_team_score, group=opponent_team_short_display_name, label = \"Iowa\"), \n          nudge_x = -.1, color = \"#D4AF37\", fontface = \"bold\") + \n  \n  geom_text(data=md |&gt; filter(team_home_away == max(team_home_away)), aes(x=team_home_away, y=opponent_team_score, group=opponent_team_short_display_name, label = \"Maryland\"),\n          nudge_x = .15, nudge_y = -.7, fontface = \"bold\") + \n  geom_text(data=md |&gt; filter(team_home_away == min(team_home_away)), aes(x=team_home_away, y=opponent_team_score, group=opponent_team_short_display_name, label = \"Maryland\"),\n          nudge_x = -.15, fontface = \"bold\") + \n  \n  geom_text(data=ohs |&gt; filter(team_home_away == max(team_home_away)), aes(x=team_home_away, y=opponent_team_score, group=opponent_team_short_display_name, label = \"Ohio State\"), nudge_x = .17, color = \"red\", fontface = \"bold\") + \n  geom_text(data=ohs |&gt; filter(team_home_away == min(team_home_away)), aes(x=team_home_away, y=opponent_team_score, group=opponent_team_short_display_name, label = \"Ohio State\"), nudge_x = -.17, color = \"red\", fontface = \"bold\") + \n\n  labs(title=\"How Does Nebraska's Defense Look at Home?\",\n       subtitle = \"This seasons, the Huskers defense looks to work better at PBA\",\n       caption=\"Source: Sports Dataverse (hoopR) | By Graycee Oeltjen\",\n       y= \"Opponent Points Scored\", x = \"Home or Away (For Nebraska)\")+\n theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 18),\n    panel.background = element_rect(fill = \"white\", color = NA),\n    plot.background = element_rect(fill = \"white\", color = NA),\n    panel.grid.major = element_line(color = \"lightgrey\"),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the 2024-2025 season, there were three teams Nebraska played both at home and away: Iowa, Maryland, and Ohio State. On the left side of the slope chart, it shows the opponents’ points scored when the Huskers were the visiting team, while on the right side, it shows the points scored when the opposing team came to play at PBA.\nIowa and Ohio State struggled more offensively when they came to play at Nebraska, while Maryland actually scored more points as the visiting team. Lower points for the opposing teams typically point to stronger defensive efforts, which could suggest some home-court advantage on the defensive end.\nStill, the results aren’t overwhelming. While the Iowa and Ohio State games make a case for some impact, it’s not enough to fully support the narrative of the high advantage PBA is believed to provide.\nAnother note- of the six games plotted above, Nebraska won one of those. So the next question is, do the Huskers actually win more games at home?\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(waffle)\nlibrary(patchwork)\nlibrary(grid)\nlibrary(gridExtra)\n\nhuskerswin &lt;- c(\"Home Wins\" = 10, \"Away Wins\" = 6)\nhuskerslose &lt;- c(\"Home Losses\" = 6, \"Away Losses\" = 8, 2)\n\nwaffle_grob &lt;- grid.grabExpr({\n  iron(\n    waffle(huskerswin, \n           rows = 3, \n           title = \"Nebraska's Wins\", \n           xlab = \"1 square = 1 win\", \n           colors = c(\"red\", \"black\")),\n    \n    waffle(huskerslose, \n           rows = 3, \n           title = \"Nebraska's Losses\", \n           xlab = \"1 square = 1 loss\", \n           colors = c(\"red\", \"black\", \"white\"))\n  )\n})\n\nmain_title &lt;- textGrob(\"Are the Huskers More Likely to Win at Home?\",\n                       gp = gpar(fontsize = 14, fontface = \"bold\"),\n                       just = \"center\")\nsub_title &lt;- textGrob(\"Out of all of Nebraska's wins and losses, there seemed to be more wins at home and more losses on the raod.\",\n                      gp = gpar(fontsize = 10),\n                      just = \"center\")\ncaption &lt;- textGrob(\"Source: Sports Dataverse (hoopR) | By Graycee Oeltjen\",\n                    gp = gpar(fontsize = 8, fontface = \"italic\"),\n                    just = \"center\")\n\ngrid.newpage()\ngrid.draw(arrangeGrob(\n  main_title,\n  sub_title,\n  waffle_grob,\n  caption,\n  ncol = 1,\n  heights = c(0.1, 0.07, 1, 0.05)\n))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn these waffle charts it is pretty simple- red is home games and black is away. The top chart shows Nebraska’s wins in the 2024-2025 season while the chart on the bottom shows the losses.\nNebraska finsihed the season with a 10-5 record at home and a 6-8 record on the road. So yes- the Huskers did win more at home, but not by a wide margin. Considering the reputation of PBA, you might expect a more dominant home record.\nWhile there are multiple other seasons worth looking at for Nebraska men’s basketball, it is pretty clear that the believed home-court advantage wasn’t a major factor for the Huskers this season.\nPinnacle Bank Arena continues to be a beloved home for Nebraska basketball and its loyal fans, but the 2024-2025 season shows us that the atmosphere alone isn’t what wins games.\nMaybe the real question isn’t if Pinnacle Bank Arena gives Nebraska an advantage, but rather how the team uses it. I believe if the Huskers use the energetic environment of PBA more efficiently, that will be what turns close games into wins."

    "text": "For over a decade, Aaron Rodgers was the face of the Green Bay Packers, leading the team in many monumental victories including a Super Bowl win against the Pittsburgh Steelers in 2011. But with Rodgers out, the future of the Packers lies in the hands of Utah State alum Jordan Love. This leaves Green Bay fans everywhere wondering: Can he do it? When push comes to shove, will Love be able to live up to the success that Rodgers once brought to the team when it matters the most?\nWhen we look at the data, the numbers may be more similar than some may think taking a look at Aaron Rodgers’ versus Jordan Love’s stats in their first two years as starters for the Packers. But, are they comparable enough to say that Jordan Love could potentially be the future of Green Bay?\nLet’s take a look.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(nflverse)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nseasons &lt;- load_player_stats (seasons = c(2008,2009,2023,2024), stat_type = \"offense\")\n\ntotalyds &lt;- seasons |&gt;\n   group_by(season, player_display_name) |&gt;\n   summarise(\n    TotalRushingYards = sum(rushing_yards, na.rm = TRUE),\n    TotalPassingYards = sum(passing_yards, na.rm = TRUE)\n    )|&gt;\n  filter(player_display_name %in% c(\"Aaron Rodgers\", \"Jordan Love\"),\n         !(player_display_name == \"Aaron Rodgers\" & season %in% c(2023, 2024))\n  )\n\ntotalydslong &lt;- totalyds |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = starts_with(\"Total\"),\n    names_to = \"Type\",\n    values_to = \"Yards\"\n  )\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=totalydslong, aes(x=player_display_name, weight=Yards, fill=Type)) +\n  scale_fill_manual(\n    values = c(\n      \"TotalPassingYards\" = \"darkgreen\",\n      \"TotalRushingYards\" = \"gold\")) +\n  labs(\n    y = \"Number of Yards\",\n    x = \"Player\",\n    title = \"Yardage Breakdown: Rodgers vs Love\",\n    subtitle = \"Aaron Rodgers comes out on top, but not by much\"\n  ) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    panel.background = element_rect(fill = \"white\", color = NA),\n    plot.background = element_rect(fill = \"white\", color = NA),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 12),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis stacked bar chart compares the total amount of passing and rushing yards in Rodgers’ and Love’s first two years starting for the Green Bay Packers. It shows that Aaron Rodgers had more yards than Jordan Love in those two years, but the difference is not substantial.\nLove definitely has some work to do, but he is on the right track to being comparable to Aaron Rodgers in this aspect. The difference in defenses also affects this stat, but that’s a story for another day.\nThrowing often is one thing, but throwing well is another. How do their completion percentages stack up?\n\n\nCode\nseasons &lt;- load_player_stats (seasons = c(2008,2009,2023,2024), stat_type = \"offense\")\n\nqbstats &lt;- seasons |&gt;\n  filter(player_display_name %in% c(\"Aaron Rodgers\", \"Jordan Love\"),\n         !(player_display_name == \"Aaron Rodgers\" & season %in% c(2023, 2024))\n  ) |&gt;\n  group_by(player_display_name, season, week)|&gt;\n  summarise(\n    Completions = sum(completions, na.rm = TRUE),\n    Attempts = sum(attempts, na.rm = TRUE),\n    PassingTD = sum(passing_tds, na.rm = TRUE)\n  ) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    CompletionPct = (Completions/Attempts * 100),\n    TdRate = (PassingTD/Attempts * 100)\n  )\nggplot(qbstats, aes(x = CompletionPct, y = TdRate, color = player_display_name)) +\n  geom_point(size = 3) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Completion Percentage\",\n    y = \"Touchdown Rate\",\n    color = \"Player\",\n    title = \"Quarterback Accuracy in Green Bay\",\n    subtitle = \"Aaron Rodgers and Jordan Love are pretty similar in this aspect\"\n  ) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"Aaron Rodgers\" = \"gold\", \"Jordan Love\" = \"darkgreen\")) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    panel.background = element_rect(fill = \"white\", color = NA),\n    plot.background = element_rect(fill = \"white\", color = NA),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis scatterplot maps completion percentage against touchdown rate for bothe Jordan Love and Aaron Rodgers. Gold dots represent Aaron Rodgers while dark green dots represent Jordan Love. The dots in the top right of the graph have a high completion percentage and a high touchdown rate- this is good. The dots in the lower left of the graph have a low completion percentage and a low touchdown rate- this is bad.\nA good quarterback is able to complete their passes, and hopefully score on them. Jordan Love does have a few more appearances in the less desirable lower left portion of the graph, but once again it is not by an overwhelming margin. Along with those dots, there are also quite a few for Jordan Love in the upper right portion of the graph, which is very promising.\nLooking at this data, it also shows that Jordan Love might just have the potential to be the next Aaron Rodgers for Green Bay. The dots are kind of all over the place, but in the grand scheme of things I would say Jordan Love is pretty comparable to Aaron Rodgers in this aspect as well.\nScoring is important, but so is avoiding costly mistakes. So how does Love compare to Rodgers on that level?\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggtext)\n\nqbrelevant &lt;- seasons |&gt;\n  filter(player_display_name %in% c(\"Aaron Rodgers\", \"Jordan Love\"),\n         !(player_display_name == \"Aaron Rodgers\" & season %in% c(2023, 2024))\n  )\n         \nqbdumbbell &lt;- qbrelevant |&gt;\n  group_by(player_display_name, season) |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    Total_TDs = sum(passing_tds, na.rm = TRUE),\n    Total_INTs = sum(interceptions, na.rm = TRUE)\n  ) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    Player_Season = paste(player_display_name, \"Year\", ifelse(season == 2008, 1, ifelse(season == 2009, 2, ifelse(season == 2023, 1, 2)))))\n\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_dumbbell(\n    data=qbdumbbell, \n    aes(y = reorder(Player_Season, Total_TDs), x = Total_TDs, xend = Total_INTs),\n    size = 2,\n    colour = \"grey\",\n    colour_x = \"green\",\n    colour_xend = \"red\") +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Touchdowns vs Interceptions\",\n    y = \"Player & Year\",\n    color = \"Player\",\n    title = \"Helping vs Hurting the Team\",\n    subtitle = \"Jordan Love outweighs Aaron Rodgers in year 1, but year 2 is a different story.\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 18, face = \"bold\"),\n    panel.background = element_rect(fill = \"white\", color = NA),\n    plot.background = element_rect(fill = \"white\", color = NA),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 8),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis dumbbell chart simply shows touchdowns versus interceptions in the first two years as starters for Love and Rodgers. The green end shows the amount of touchdowns while the red end shows interceptions. The further left the red dot, the better. Yes, scoring wins games, but giving the other team the ball could cost you a game.\nOut of the four years, Jordan Love had the most amount of touchdowns in his first year as a starter, but he also had the least amount of touchdowns in his second year. Love struggled a little more in his second year having the closest margin between interceptions and touchdowns. This being said, Aaron Rodgers had the least amount of interceptions in his second year.\nLooking at the numbers, Jordan Love might not quite be on the level Aaron Rodgers was during his first two years as a starting quarterback for the Green Bay Packers, but Love is definitely on the right track. Could Jordan Love be the future of the Packers? Maybe. Love has the potential to be great, but only time will tell if he puts that potential in action. He may take his own path and might just be what Green Bay needs. But once again, the only way to know that for sure is to just wait and see what the future holds."
